It can be\n *     overwritten with the `tomtom.key()` method globally or per service  with `tomtom.<service_name>.key()` functions.\n *     It is also possible to pass a specific key while working with instances of the services.\n * @param {\"main\"|\"night\"} [options.style=\"main\"] The base map style to be used.\n * @param {\"basic\"|\"hybrid\"|\"labels\"} [options.layer=\"basic\"] The base map's layer to be used.\n * @param {\"Unified\"|\"IN\"} [options.geopolView] Define the geopolitical view for the new map instance.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.traffic] Allows to easily add the\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} and\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficIncidentsLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} layers to the map. A value of this parameter can\n *     be set to an options object as described in the traffic layer documentation.\n *     If traffic layers are added with this option, a mechanism for periodic refresh of the traffic data is provided\n *     (using a proper traffic model id handling).\n * @param {Boolean} [options.traffic.noRefresh] Disables periodic updates of traffic layers.\n * @param {Number} [options.traffic.refresh=30000] The traffic incidents information changes and needs to be updated\n *     periodically. By default, it is refreshed every 30 seconds. This parameter's value represents the time\n *     in milliseconds between each update interval. The value must be 0 or greater.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.trafficFlow] Allows to add {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficFlowLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n *     to the map. A value of this parameter can be set to the options object as described in the traffic flow layer\n *     documentation.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.noLabelsOnTop=false] If a traffic or traffic flow layer is overlayed on the map, then by\n *     default, the labels layer is added on top of these layers. It prevents labels from being covered by the traffic\n *     tubes or traffic flow. With this option, it is possible to disable this behaviour.\n * @param {String|String[]} [options.source=\"raster\"] Sets the initial source and determines which tiles types will be\n *     displayed (raster, vector). If an array is given first item is used as a default source and next items are\n *     initialized but not displayed. If MapboxGL JS dependency is not met vector layer will not initialize.\n * @param {String} [options.glyphsUrl] Glyphs are fonts in PBF required to display labels on vector maps. The Url must\n * contain the {fontstack} and {range} tokens. The SDK distributable already contains the glyphs required by the default\n * vector styles - you just need to provide a path to them on your server.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf\"\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.basePath = '/sdk'] Base path for sdk. It will be used in relative paths - it is especially\n * important for maps with vector sources. E.g if you set this option to `\"/myPath\"`, default urls for styles will\n * be set to `/myPath/styles/basic_main.json`.\n * This property is used only if you do not provide custom mapping for given url mapping.\n * @param {Object} [options.styleUrlMapping] Overrides the default URLs for vector style files.\n * The default value is as follows:\n * ```javascript\n * {\n *   main: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_main.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_main.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_main.json'\n *   },\n *   night: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_night.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_night.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_night.json'\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.spriteUrl] Set the base URL for the sprite image and metadata. The extensions .png, .json\n * and scale factor will be appended at the end of URL automatically. The sprite URL is required to display icons\n * like road shields on vector maps.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/sprite/sprite\"\n * ```\n * @param {Boolean} [options.zoomControl=true] Show a zoom control at the top left corner of the map.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.panControl=false] Enable the pan controls at the top left corner of the map.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.zoomsliderControl=false] Shows a vertical slider to control the zoom level.\n * It is recommended to disable the default zoom control option (`zoomControl=false`) when you use this feature.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.worldCopyJump=true]\n * @param {String} [options.language] Language to be used for map labels.

If isn't define the name of the property will be used.\n *  - validator: Function(value) If the value isn't valid this function should throw an Error,\n *      otherwise it should return the value validated\n *  - defaultValue: Function() This function have to return the default value\n *  - converter: Function(value) The returned value of this function will be used\n *\n * This is an example of configurations this module could take:\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {\n *     name: 'bestCity',\n *     validator: function (name) {\n *       if (typeof name !== 'string' || name.length === 0) throw new Error('City name is not valid');\n *       return name;\n *     },\n *     converter: function (name) {\n *       return name.toLowerCase();\n *     },\n *     defaultValue: function() {\n *       return 'Lodz';\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * var config = require('chain')(properties);\n * config.city(); // prints \"lodz\"\n * config.city('Torun'); // prints \"torun\"\n * config.city(); // prints \"torun\"\n * ```\n *\n * Take notice the converter function is always executed, even for the default value.\n *\n * As second argument a function will be expected and this function will be executed using the \"go\" method\n * returned by this constructor.\n * The additional functions returned by this constructor are: \"go\", \"callback\" and \"fail\".\n *\n * The \"go\" function will execute the function passed as second argument of the constructor which should\n * implement the next signature: goFunction(properties, callback) .\n *\n * Is expected that the \"goFunction\" will call the callback function available in the second argument which is the same\n * function defined in fields.callback or the first argument passed to the \"go\" function.\n *\n * The \"go\" method can receive two callback arguments: \"success\" and \"fail\" which will override the initial callbacks\n * defined during the creation and will be continue to be used in the next execution of the \"go\" function.\n *\n * If a callback is not provided nor in the fields.callback or as first argument of the \"go\" call,\n * then the \"go\" function will return a Promise, otherwise this function will return undefined.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {},\n *   country: {}\n * }\n * var defaults = {city: 'Lima', country: 'Peru'};\n * function sendToBackend(properties, callback) {\n *   // Ajax call sending the properties\n *   // ...\n *   callback(\"OK\");\n * }\n * function onSuccess() {};\n * function onfail() {};\n *\n * var config = require('chain')(properties, sendToBackend, defaults);\n *\n * // Calling \"go\" passing callbacks\n * config.go(onSuccess, onfail);\n *\n * // Calling go and receive a Promise\n * config.go()\n *   .then(onSuccess)\n *   .catch(onFail);\n * ```\n *\n * Do you think this was difficult to read?

service](https://developer.tomtom.com/online-search/online-search-documentation-reverse-geocoding/reverse-geocode).\n *\n * Parameters can be passed to the constructor or provided via convenient methods that can be chained until\n * the method {{#crossLink \"ReverseGeocode/go:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} performs the actual call.\n *\n * The call is asynchronous therefore the user have two options for receive the response:\n *  - Passing a callback function.\n *  - Use the {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} returned by the\n *   {{#crossLink

API](https://developer.tomtom.com/online-routing/online-routing-documentation-routing/calculate-route);\n *\n * Parameters can be passed to the constructor or provided via convenient methods that can be chained until\n * the method go performs the actual call.\n *\n * The call is asynchronous therefore the user has two options to receive the response:\n *  - Passing a callback function.\n *  - Use the {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} returned by the\n *    go method to handle the response.\n *\n * The SDK provides a {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} polyfill for browsers (IE<9)\n * without native ECMAScript 6 support.\n *\n * ### The types used in routing service\n *  - point - latitude, longitude pair (in EPSG4326 projection), with the following constraints:\n *    - Latitude values must be in the range -90..+90 inclusive.\n *    - Longitude values must be in the range -180..+180 inclusive.\n *    - Example: 52.37245,4.89406\n *\n *  - circle - A circle with a center point and a radius (in meters).\n *    - The radius must be a positive integer with the maximum value of 20050000.\n *    - Note that larger integer values will not be rejected but lowered to the maximum value.\n *    - Example: circle(52.37245,4.89406,10000)\n *\n *  - location - A point or a circle.\n *    - Example: 52.37245,4.89406  circle(52.37245,4.89406,10000)\n *\n *  - dateTime - A date and time specified in RFC-3339 format with an optional time zone offset.\n *    - Example: 1996-12-19T16:39:57  1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00\n *\n * @class Routing\n * @module Services\n * @uses Chain\n *

120};\n * var map = new L.Map(\"map\");\n * var miniMapControl = new L.TomTomMinimap(miniMapOptions);\n * miniMapControl.addTo(map);\n * ```\n *\n * @example\n * ```javascript\n * var widget = new L.TomTomMinimap({\n *   height: 90,\n *   width: 120,\n *   // zoom difference between the main map and minimaps (defaults to -8)\n *   zoomLevelOffset: -8,\n *\n *   // below options have default

You can pass in a LatLng-equivalent object.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.zoomAnimation=false] Sets whether the minimap should have an animated zoom.\n *     (Will cause it to lag a bit after the movement of the main map.)\n * @param {Boolean} [options.toggleDisplay=false] Sets whether the minimap should have a button to minimize it\n * @param {Boolean} [options.autoToggleDisplay=false] Sets whether the minimap should hide automatically\n *     if the parent map bounds does not fit within the minimap bounds.\n *     Especially useful when `zoomLevelFixed` is set.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.minimized=false] Sets whether the minimap should start in a minimized position\n * @param {Object} [options.aimingRectOptions] Sets the style of the aiming rectangle by passing in\n *     a <a href=\"http://leafletjs.com/reference-${leaflet.version}.html#path-options\">Path.Options object</a>.\n *     (Clickable will always be overridden and set to `false`).\n * @param {Object} [options.shadowRectOptions] Sets the style of the aiming shadow rectangle by passing in a\n *     <a href=\"http://leafletjs.com/reference-${leaflet.version}.html#path-options\">Path.Options object</a>.\n *     (Clickable will always be overridden and set to `false`).\n * @param {Object} [options.strings] Overrides the default strings allowing for translation\n * @param {Object} [options.mapOptions] Sets Leaflet options for the MiniMap.\n *     It does not override the MiniMap default map options but extends them.\n *     See regular map options for more details.\n * @param {String} [options.basePath = '/sdk'] Base path for sdk. It will be used in relative paths - it is \n * especially important for maps with vector sources.

It can be\n *     overwritten with the `tomtom.key()` method globally or per service  with `tomtom.<service_name>.key()` functions.\n *     It is also possible to pass a specific key while working with instances of the services.\n * @param {\"main\"|\"night\"} [options.style=\"main\"] The base map style to be used.\n * @param {\"basic\"|\"hybrid\"|\"labels\"} [options.layer=\"basic\"] The base map's layer to be used.\n * @param {\"Unified\"|\"IN\"} [options.geopolView] Define the geopolitical view for the new map instance.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.traffic] Allows to easily add the\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} and\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficIncidentsLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} layers to the map. A value of this parameter can\n *     be set to an options object as described in the traffic layer documentation.\n *     If traffic layers are added with this option, a mechanism for periodic refresh of the traffic data is provided\n *     (using a proper traffic model id handling).\n * @param {Boolean} [options.traffic.noRefresh] Disables periodic updates of traffic layers.\n * @param {Number} [options.traffic.refresh=30000] The traffic incidents information changes and needs to be updated\n *     periodically. By default, it is refreshed every 30 seconds. This parameter's value represents the time\n *     in milliseconds between each update interval. The value must be 0 or greater.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.trafficFlow] Allows to add {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficFlowLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n *     to the map. A value of this parameter can be set to the options object as described in the traffic flow layer\n *     documentation.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.noLabelsOnTop=false] If a traffic or traffic flow layer is overlayed on the map, then by\n *     default, the labels layer is added on top of these layers. It prevents labels from being covered by the traffic\n *     tubes or traffic flow. With this option, it is possible to disable this behaviour.\n * @param {String|String[]} [options.source=\"raster\"] Sets the initial source and determines which tiles types will be\n *     displayed (raster, vector). If an array is given first item is used as a default source and next items are\n *     initialized but not displayed. If MapboxGL JS dependency is not met vector layer will not initialize.\n * @param {String} [options.glyphsUrl] Glyphs are fonts in PBF required to display labels on vector maps. The Url must\n * contain the {fontstack} and {range} tokens. The SDK distributable already contains the glyphs required by the default\n * vector styles - you just need to provide a path to them on your server.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf\"\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.basePath = '/sdk'] Base path for sdk. It will be used in relative paths - it is especially\n * important for maps with vector sources. E.g if you set this option to `\"/myPath\"`, default urls for styles will\n * be set to `/myPath/styles/basic_main.json`.\n * This property is used only if you do not provide custom mapping for given url mapping.\n * @param {Object} [options.styleUrlMapping] Overrides the default URLs for vector style files.\n * The default value is as follows:\n * ```javascript\n * {\n *   main: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_main.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_main.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_main.json'\n *   },\n *   night: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_night.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_night.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_night.json'\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.spriteUrl] Set the base URL for the sprite image and metadata. The extensions .png, .json\n * and scale factor will be appended at the end of URL automatically. The sprite URL is required to display icons\n * like road shields on vector maps.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/sprite/sprite\"\n * ```\n * @param {Boolean} [options.zoomControl=true] Show a zoom control at the top left corner of the map.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.panControl=false] Enable the pan controls at the top left corner of the map.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.zoomsliderControl=false] Shows a vertical slider to control the zoom level.\n * It is recommended to disable the default zoom control option (`zoomControl=false`) when you use this feature.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.worldCopyJump=true]\n * @param {String} [options.language] Language to be used for map labels.

module has two utilities:\n *\n * This module create getters and setters for every property of the object passed as first argument and also\n * implement the \"go\" method which executed an arbitrary function passing all the property values.\n *\n * To create the getters and setters the first argument of the constructor should be an object with the\n * following accepted properties:\n *\n *  - name: String Custom name of the property. If isn't define the name of the property will be used.\n *  - validator: Function(value) If the value isn't valid this function should throw an Error,\n *      otherwise it should return the value validated\n *  - defaultValue: Function() This function have to return the default value\n *  - converter: Function(value) The returned value of this function will be used\n *\n * This is an example of configurations this module could take:\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {\n *     name: 'bestCity',\n *     validator: function (name) {\n *       if (typeof name !== 'string' || name.length === 0) throw new Error('City name is not valid');\n *       return name;\n *     },\n *     converter: function (name) {\n *       return name.toLowerCase();\n *     },\n *     defaultValue: function() {\n *       return 'Lodz';\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * var config = require('chain')(properties);\n * config.city(); // prints \"lodz\"\n * config.city('Torun'); // prints \"torun\"\n * config.city(); // prints \"torun\"\n * ```\n *\n * Take notice the converter function is always executed, even for the default value.\n *\n * As second argument a function will be expected and this function will be executed using the \"go\" method\n * returned by this constructor.\n * The additional functions returned by this constructor are: \"go\", \"callback\" and \"fail\".\n *\n * The \"go\" function will execute the function passed as second argument of the constructor which should\n * implement the next signature: goFunction(properties, callback) .\n *\n * Is expected that the \"goFunction\" will call the callback function available in the second argument which is the same\n * function defined in fields.callback or the first argument passed to the \"go\" function.\n *\n * The \"go\" method can receive two callback arguments: \"success\" and \"fail\" which will override the initial callbacks\n * defined during the creation and will be continue to be used in the next execution of the \"go\" function.\n *\n * If a callback is not provided nor in the fields.callback or as first argument of the \"go\" call,\n * then the \"go\" function will return a Promise, otherwise this function will return undefined.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {},\n *   country: {}\n * }\n * var defaults = {city: 'Lima', country: 'Peru'};\n * function sendToBackend(properties, callback) {\n *   // Ajax call sending the properties\n *   // ...\n *   callback(\"OK\");\n * }\n * function onSuccess() {};\n * function onfail() {};\n *\n * var config = require('chain')(properties, sendToBackend, defaults);\n *\n * // Calling \"go\" passing callbacks\n * config.go(onSuccess, onfail);\n *\n * // Calling go and receive a Promise\n * config.go()\n *   .then(onSuccess)\n *   .catch(onFail);\n * ```\n *\n * Do you think this was difficult to read? Believe me, the most difficult was to write it.\n * @private\n * @class Chain\n * @module Services\n * @constructor\n * @param {Object}   fields\n * @param {Function} fields.callback Default callback function to be executed by \"goFunction\" function\n * @param {Function} fields.fail Default fail function callback to be executed by \"goFunction\" function\n * @param {Function} [goFunction] Should have the signature: function(properties, callback): Promise|undefined\n * @param {Object}   [options] Object with the initial values for the properties defined in the \"fields\" argument\n * @param {Function} [options.fail] Failsafe \"fail\" function to be executed by \"goFunction\" callback argument.\n *                                  It will override \"fields.fail\" (yeah, don't ask me why)\n */\n\n/**\n * Executes a predefined asynchronous task using the current configuration and then execute one of\n * the callback functions based on the success of the result.\n *\n * It receives two optional arguments. The first one is a callback function that will be used when\n * the task is successfully completed. The second one is another callback function\n * that will be used only in case of failure.\n *\n * Both arguments are shortcuts for the <b>callback</b> and <b>fail</b> methods respectively.\n *\n * @example\n * All the ways of using this method:\n * ```js\n * // Defining callbacks as function arguments\n * tomtom.fuzzySearch()\n *   .query(\"pizza\")\n *   .go(successCallback, failureCallback);\n *\n * // Defining callbacks using setters methods\n * tomtom.fuzzySearch()\n *   .query(\"pizza\")\n *   .callback(successCallback)\n *   .fail(failureCallback)\n *   .go();\n *\n * // Using the returned Promise\n * tomtom.fuzzySearch()\n *   .query(\"pizza\")\n *   .go()\n *   .then(successCallback)\n *   .catch(failureCallback);\n * ```\n * The SDK provides a Promise polyfill for browsers (IE<9) without native ECMAScript 6 support.\n *\n * @method go\n * @param {Function} [success] The callback function to be called on case of success\n * @param {Function} [fail] The callback function to be called on case of failure.\n *     If a success callback was not given this argument will be ignored. In that case the returned Promise\n *     should be used to handle the failures.\n * @return {Promise|null} If the success callback is omitted (and wasn't defined one yet) this function\n *     will return a Promise\n */\n\n/**\n * Sets or gets the value of the option `callback`.\n *\n * This callback function will be called only after the <b>go</b> method successfully complete its task.\n *\n * Its first and unique argument passed to the callback will be the result of the request.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * function callbackFn(results) {\n *   console.log(results);\n * }\n * tomtom.fuzzySearch()\n *   .query(\"pizza\")\n *   .callback(callbackFn)\n *   .go();\n * ```\n *\n * @method callback\n * @chainable\n * @param {Function} [newValue] The new callback function\n * @throws {TypeError} If the given argument is not a function\n * @return {Function} The same service instance or the current callback function if no argument was given\n */\n\n/**\n * Sets or gets the value of the option `fail`.\n *\n * This function is called when an error occurs (e.g. invalid values or a communication error).\n *\n * The callback will receive just one argument which is the error description.\n *\n * This parameter will be ignored if the callback function is not defined and therefore the\n * <b>go</b> method will return a Promise that will be rejected if an error occurs.\n *\n * If you don't specificy a failure callback, the default behavior in case of encounter a problem is to\n * throw an error.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * function successCallback(results) {\n *   console.log(results);\n * }\n * function failureCallback(error) {\n *   console.log(error);\n * }\n * tomtom.fuzzySearch()\n *   .query(\"pizza\")\n *   .callback(successCallback)\n *   .fail(failureCallback)\n *   .go();\n * ```\n *\n * @method fail\n * @chainable\n * @param {Function} [newValue] The new callback function\n * @throws {TypeError} If the given argument is not a function\n * @return {Function} The same service instance or the current callback function if no argument was given\n */\n/* jshint nomen:false */\ndefine(['./utils',\n

using the TomTom's\n * [Reverse Geocode service](https://developer.tomtom.com/online-search/online-search-documentation-reverse-geocoding/reverse-geocode).\n *\n * Parameters can be passed to the constructor or provided via convenient methods that can be chained until\n * the method {{#crossLink \"ReverseGeocode/go:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} performs the actual call.\n *\n * The call is asynchronous therefore the user have two options for receive the response:\n *  - Passing a callback function.\n *  - Use the {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} returned by the\n *   {{#crossLink \"ReverseGeocode/go:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} method to handle the response.\n *\n * The SDK provides a {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} polyfill for browsers (IE<9)\n * without native ECMAScript 6 support.\n *\n * The final response from service is a JSON object with the following structure:\n *\n* ```js\n * {\n *   \"summary\": {\n *       \"queryTime\": 172,\n *

API](https://developer.tomtom.com/online-routing/online-routing-documentation-routing/calculate-route);\n *\n * Parameters can be passed to the constructor or provided via convenient methods that can be chained until\n * the method go performs the actual call.\n *\n * The call is asynchronous therefore the user has two options to receive the response:\n *  - Passing a callback function.\n *  - Use the {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} returned by the\n *    go method to handle the response.\n *\n * The SDK provides a {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} polyfill for browsers (IE<9)\n * without native ECMAScript 6 support.\n *\n * ### The types used in routing service\n *  - point - latitude, longitude pair (in EPSG4326 projection), with the following constraints:\n *    - Latitude values must be in the range -90..+90 inclusive.\n *    - Longitude values must be in the range -180..+180 inclusive.\n *    - Example: 52.37245,4.89406\n *\n *  - circle - A circle with a center point and a radius (in meters).\n *    - The radius must be a positive integer with the maximum value of 20050000.\n *    - Note that larger integer values will not be rejected but lowered to the maximum value.\n *    - Example: circle(52.37245,4.89406,10000)\n *\n *  - location - A point or a circle.\n *    - Example: 52.37245,4.89406  circle(52.37245,4.89406,10000)\n *\n *  - dateTime - A date and time specified in RFC-3339 format with an optional time zone offset.\n *    - Example: 1996-12-19T16:39:57  1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00\n *\n * @class Routing\n * @module Services\n * @uses Chain\n *

var miniMapControl = new L.TomTomMinimap(miniMapOptions);\n * miniMapControl.addTo(map);\n * ```\n *\n * @example\n * ```javascript\n * var widget = new L.TomTomMinimap({\n *   height: 90,\n *   width: 120,\n *   // zoom difference between the main map and minimaps (defaults to -8)\n *   zoomLevelOffset: -8,\n *\n *   // below options have default values:\n *   toggleDisplay: true,     //
